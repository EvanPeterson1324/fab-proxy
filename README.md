# Notice of Deprecation

Unfortunately I have not had time to keep up to date with this project and in the meantime someone else has taken the same idea and seems to be supporting it better. So head over to [fabproxy.com](https://fabproxy.com/) and try it out!

# FAB Proxy

A tool to help with printing out proxy cards for Flesh and Blood. Check it out in action [here](https://cgilling.github.io/fab-proxy/).

## Caveat

This was a fun project I through together and used it as a way to play around with React. I have very little front end experience, and haven't (yet) gone through the trouble to actually have the code organized in a good fashion. So please be kind if you happen to read through the code (I agree, its a mess!).
